 //Answer make sure to answer all of the questions between the questions that follow

// The following exercise consists of DOM manipulation, variables, conditional statements, loops, arrays and objects Everything you have covered so far.
// The questions will vary with difficulty and you may be required to combine more than one topic to complete a certain exercise. 
// ***You will not be allowed to use Youtube solutions if you are unable to explain your solutions that follow. After I check your answer and you cannot explain your code, I will mark it as a strike against your name.
// AIM: To complete the exercise fully without any assistance as much as possible.
// REMEMBER:   The feeling for anxiousness and excitement is that of a fine line...Physiologically they are almost identical. 
//             The feeling you're feeling is excitement not nervousness. I know you got this! I believe in you even if you don't believe in yourself!:)


// 1. Use the following id="heading" to change the heading(This is the main heading) of the html to 'Javascript', DO NOT USE QUERY SELECTOR
document.getElementById('heading').innerText='JavaScript'


// 2. Use the class='paragraph' and change the information to 'This is a language I have mastered and I am proud of myself. I complished this because I believed in myself'
document.getElementsByClassName('paragraph')[0].innerText='This is a language I have mastered and I am proud of myself. I complished this because I believed in myself'

// 3. Use the h3 element and change the heading(Subheading) to 'Things I've accomplished so far'. Hint: use querySelector
document.querySelector('h3').innerText='This I\'ve accomplished'

// 4. Change the paragraph below Question3(above) to 'I have discovered that I can accomplish anything I put my mind to'Hint: Use querySelectorAll and index or use getElementByTagName and index
document.getElementsByTagName('p')[1].innerText='I have discovered that I can accomplish anything I put my mind to'

// So far you have hints, however the hints have lessened.
// 5.1. Attach the first input to a variable
// let multiply = document.querySelector('[data-firstMultiply]').value
// 5.2. Attach the second input to a variable
// let x = document.querySelector('[data-secondMultiply]').value
// 5.3. Attach the FIRST button to a variable(going to add an eventListener to button)
let btn = document.querySelector('[data-calculate1]')
// 5.4. Attach the FIRST span element to a variable(To display the information to)
let display = document.querySelector('[data-first]')
//         P.S. for the next step make use of console.log() to keep track of where data is going  
// 5.5. Create a normal function that allows us to multiply the 2 inputs together and writes the information to the FIRST span element.
function multiply(){
    let multiply = document.querySelector('[data-firstMultiply]').value  
    let x = document.querySelector('[data-secondMultiply]').value
    let answer = eval(`${multiply}*${x}`)
    console.log(answer);
    display.innerText = answer
}
// 5.6. Add an event listener to the button that runs the function that tyou created
btn.addEventListener('click', multiply)
// 5.7 Hmm......Did you forget to make your input tags return a value instead of the element? (0.0)
//     Or did you forget we are writing to an element not an input?....which means your answer will be displayed with innerText

// Okay, that was pretty awesome...not too bad when you have the steps?

// 6. Now you will have to return the calculation of the 2 numbers from the modulus input for eg.......4....%....2....= 0
// 6.1 Set the first modulus input to a variable 
let firstDivide = document.querySelector('[data-firstModulus]').value
// 6.2 Set the send modulud input to a variable
let secondDivide = document.querySelector('[data-secondModulus]').value
// 6.3 Set the SECOND span to a varable(will display answer)
let display2 = document.querySelector('[data-second]')
// 6.4 Set the SECOND button to a variable(to run event listener)
let btn2 = document.getElementById('calculate2')
// 6.5 Create a normal function to calculate the modulus of the inputs
function modulus(){
    let firstDivide = document.querySelector('[data-firstModulus]').value
    let secondDivide = document.querySelector('[data-secondModulus]').value
    let answer = eval(`${firstDivide}% ${secondDivide}`)
    console.log(answer)
    display2.innerText = answer
}
// 6.6 Add an event listener to the button which will run the function you created
btn2.addEventListener('click', modulus)

// Hmmm......That wasn't too bad....I knew you could do it! I believe in you.
// You should now have an idea of the steps neccesary to complete actions using DOM manipulation.

// Okay now that you are aware of the steps needed, try no 7
// 7.1 Change the text of 'Bubble Tea' to 'White Tea'
document.getElementById('bubbleTea').innerText='White Tea'
// 7.2 Change the text of 'Green Tea' to 'Black tea'
document.getElementsByClassName('greenTea')[0].innerText='Black Tea'
// 7.3 Change the text of 'Iced Tea' to 'Herbal Tea'
document.querySelector('[data-icedTea]').innerText='Herbal Tea'

// You're eating Javascript, and again....I'm proud of you!

// 8. Declare a variable called lastName and add a value to it(value must be a string)
let lastName = 'Putin'
// 9. Declare a variable called parentsAge and give it a value of 20(value must be a number)
let parentsAge = 20;
// 10. Create an array with called coolCars and give it the following value: ['BMW','Bugati','Ferrari','McLaren', 'Mercedes']

let coolCars = ['BMW', 'Bugati', 'Ferrari', 'McLaren', 'Mercedes']

//             Now to manipulate the arrays. ;)
// 11. Write the code to change the 'McLaren' value to 'Lamborghini' in the array Hint: use indexing to access different values in arrays
coolCars[3]='Lamborghini'
// 12. Use a for loop to loop through the array, and console.log every value inside of the array.

for(let car=0;car<coolCars.length;car++){
    console.log(coolCars[car]);
}

// 13. Reverse the array and console.log the reversed array.

let newCoolCars = coolCars.reverse()

console.log(newCoolCars);

// 14. Write the code to remove the last item in the array(coolCars not the reversed array) and store it in a variable....which means your array of coolCars must look like : ['BMW','Bugati','Ferrari','Lamborghini]

let coolCarsLastItemRemove = coolCars.slice(0, -1)

// 15. Now write the code to use the variable you made in no.14 and add it to the FRONT of the array. Your coolCars array should now look like:
// [ 'Mercedes', 'BMW', 'Bugati', 'Ferrari', 'Lamborghini']



//             Time to SWITCH it up a bit
// 16. Write a simple conditional statement that will check if someone is younger than 18 or older than 18. The variable will be called age = 18 then a=17 to check
let age = 18
let a = 17
if(a>=age){
    console.log(`Is 18 or older`);
} else {
    console.log(`Younger than 18`);
}


// 17. Make use of a switch statement and create a possible soultion for no.16

switch(true){
    case a>=18:
        console.log(`Is 18 or older`);
        break
    case a<18:
        console.log(`Younger than 18`);
        break
}

// 18.     USE A SWITCH statement!!!!!
// A students Maths mark was 77%,their Physics marks was 70% and their English was 50%. You are required to calculate their average mark. Then we can check the average mark and return a messageto the console, if averageMark is :

//         79%-70%(message="You average was good, it was ..."),

// 19. USE the variable that you created in question 9 and use a while loop to print each iteration to the console and at that same instance, increase the variable used by 1

let U = 0;

do {
    console.log(U);
    U += 1;
} while (U <= 20);

do {

    U++;
} while (U<coolCars.length)

// 21. Create an object called chair and give it a 
//         property of legs and a value of 4,

let chair = {
    legs: 4,
    material: 'plastic'
}

//         a secondProperty of material with a value of plastic
// 22. Write the code that adds a property of 
//         'armRestBars' with a value of 'none' 
//         to the chair object.
chair.armRestBars='none'
// 23.1.   What code will I write to view the value of the armRestBars.

chair.armRestBars

// 23.2    What code can I use to delete the property of legs with the value of 4.

delete chair.legs


// 24. Create an factory function that can be used to return objects of electrical devices.

// 30. Use the array in question10 that you created and create a conditional statement that check if 'BMW' appears in the array. The console should return 'This item does appear in the array' or 'The item does not appear in the array'
